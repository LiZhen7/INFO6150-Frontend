                <h2>What is League of Legends?</h2>
                <p>
                    League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena
                    video
                    game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for
                    Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its
                    release
                    in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character
                    customization. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.

                <h2>New Team-Based Strategy Game</h2>
                <p>
                    In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying
                    and
                    defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a
                    "champion",
                    with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful
                    by
                    collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In the
                    game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying
                    their
                    "Nexus", a large structure located within.
